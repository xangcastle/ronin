**Ronin** is the masterless coding agent, serving only your code.

## ⚡ The Philosophy: Stability in a Volatile World

**Ronin** was born from a simple observation: **proprietary tools are volatile.** We've all seen the cycle: excellent tools attract early adopters with "unlimited" promises, only to alter the deal, cap productivity, or change Terms of Service overnight when the economics shift.

We believe a developer's environment should be **deterministic infrastructure**, not a shifting service. You shouldn't be penalized for being "too productive" — and your workflow shouldn't break because a company decides to pivot.

**Ronin is different.** We are removing the rent-seeking layer entirely. This is about trust, sovereignty, and code.

## 🛡️ The Ronin Covenant

Unlike services that operate as "black boxes," Ronin operates on three non-negotiable rules designed to future-proof your workflow:

### 1. Sovereignty (Bring Your Own Key)
**You provide the brains; Ronin provides the body.** Connect directly to OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek using your own keys. 
* **No middleman markup.**
* **No "pooled capacity" limits.**
* **No opaque tiers.** As long as you have a key, Ronin works.

### 2. Privacy & Independence (Local-First)
A companion that relies 100% on the cloud isn't a tool; it's a dependency.
Ronin treats `localhost` as a first-class citizen. With native support for **Ollama** and local LLMs, you can build entirely offline. Your code never leaves your machine unless *you* decide to send it.

### 3. Radical Transparency (No Rug-Pulls)
Ronin is client-side software. We cannot downgrade your tier because **there is no tier**. We cannot revoke your access because the code lives on your machine.

> **"Reliability is not an optional feature. It is the baseline."**

## 🚀 Why This Matters

As engineers, we need tools that respect our expertise:

1.  **Deterministic:** Terms of Service shouldn't change based on a company's burn rate.
2.  **Transparent:** Limits should be explicit (defined by your API provider), not hidden behind vague definitions of "abuse."
3.  **Accessible:** By providing full access to the source code, we ensure this tool belongs to the community, forever.

Ronin doesn't have a hidden agenda or a "fair usage policy" designed to slow you down. **Ronin just wants to help you ship code.**
